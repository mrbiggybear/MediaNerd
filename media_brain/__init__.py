        I want to utilize IMDB as a source of TV and Movie targets.
        I plan to retrieve media data and create a local listing for
        each media item. This will repeat and will need to keep from
        forming duplicates.
        If there is not media file found locally. 
        Any missing media will attempt to be downloaded.
        
        Media management will be the scope of a seperate applicaiton.
